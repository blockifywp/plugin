== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What themes does this plugin work with? =

This plugin is designed to work with any Full Site Editing block theme.

= Where is the settings page? =

This plugin provides no settings page. All settings are available in the block editor.

= How do I add icons to the editor? =

SVG Icons can be created by inserting an Image block anywhere in the block editor and then selecting the "SVG Icon" block style from the right sidebar settings. The original image is not loaded and the selected SVG icon is displayed instead. To add a gradient to an icon, select a gradient from the Background Color setting and clear any colors from the Text Color setting.

= How do I add a custom icon set to the editor? =

Custom icon sets can be added by passing the path to the icons to the Blockify config. Please see the default Blockify theme for an example.

= What version of PHP do I need? =

PHP 7.4 or higher is required. Lower versions are no longer supported.

= How to enable/disable specific blocks? =

Copy and paste the code snippet below to get started:

`
namespace Custom\Theme;

add_filter( 'blockify_block_types', __NAMESPACE__ . '\\custom_block_types' );
/**
 * Customize Blockify config.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 *
 * @param array $defaults Default Blockify config.
 *
 * @return array Custom config.
 */
function custom_block_types( array $defaults ) : array {
    return [
        'accordion',
        'icon',
    ];
}
`

= How do I add code snippets for filter and action hooks? =

Parent themes, child themes and plugins can all be used to modify the default behaviour of Blockify. Every function is either added with a filter or an action which provides developers more control.

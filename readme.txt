== Description ==

A lightweight block library and toolkit that enhances the full site editing experience. Launching soon ðŸš€

## Block Extensions ##

Block extensions are additional controls added to core blocks. They are helpful with site building, allowing you finer control over each blocks appearance.

**Box Shadow:** Create box shadows on almost any type of block.

**Absolute Positioning:** One of the most powerful, yet simple features. Blockifys positioning settings allow you to change the positioning of almost any block, including absolute positioning, creating an unlimited amount of design possibilites.

**CSS Transform:** Create modern effects by applying CSS Transforms to commonly used blocks.

**CSS Filters:** Add CSS filter effects to blocks of any kind.

**Block Styles:** Blockify avoids the use of block styles where possible and only uses them where it makes sense. Some block styles included are checklists and numbered lists.

**Reverse Mobile:** Need your columns to reverse their order on mobile only? Easily check the setting and columns will reverse their order on mobile.

## Text Format Effects ##

**NEW! Text Gradients:** Add custom text gradients to paragraphs, headings, button text and more!

**Clear Formatting:** Removes all formatting from selected text.

**Font Size:** Set custom font sizes on selection of text.

**Underline:** Set custom underline styles on selection of text.

## Extra Features ##

**Google Fonts:** Automatically downloads and serves Google Fonts locally for better performance. Blockify provides a selection of variable Google fonts for you to choose from and select from the site editor.

**Block Supports:** Additional block support is added by default to allow a wider range of controls and settings on all core blocks, which provides finer control over your entire site. A PHP filter is provided for developers to modify block support settings.

**Style Patterns:** Blockify allows you to create style-specific patterns. It will search for block patterns and categories in the current theme and automatically register them with WordPress. Patterns placed in sub directories will only be loaded when the matching style variation is selected.

**Hide Page Title:** Hides the default placement of the page title in the editor and moves it out of the way to the sidebar on pages and selected custom post types.

**SVG Support:** Extra code has been included to enable SVG support in the image, gallery and site logo blocks.
